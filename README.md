Googlemap
=============
there is some of my tests with googlemap

Animated googlemap
---------
An override of the google.maps.panTo method to allow you to control the animation duration and to have a callback

Textured Googlemap
-------------
A very experimental trick : create a custom googlemap, with a texture on top of it
